# Flushing Tech Website

Welcome to the Flushing Tech website repository! This repo is dedicated to building a new website for the Flushing Tech Meetup Group. The group currently has a website ([flushingtech.org](https://flushingtech.org)) built in Svelte, but we are transitioning to Next.js and React. Additionally, we now have a designer and PM on the team and would like to apply a more cross-functional approach to build a more visually appealing and user-friendly website.

## Background on the Group

Flushing Tech is a group for people from any skill level interested in technology. The group hosts multiple events, including in-person and virtual "hackathon" events where people come together, brainstorm project ideas, and then work on those projects together. The group also currently has a virtual "office hours" event where people vote on tech discussion topics. The group has an active Discord page, and people sign up for events through Meetup. The group also has a GitHub where some of the group's projects are hosted.


## About the Project

This website will be built using Next.js and React, aiming to serve multiple purposes:

- **Introduction to the Group**: Explain what Flushing Tech is all about.
- **Event Information**: Provide details about upcoming events and how to sign up.
- **Project Showcase**: Display projects that have come out of the Flushing Tech group.

### Future Features

Our roadmap includes several exciting features:

- **Voting Page**: A page that allows members to vote on the next hackathon project ideas before attending the in-person event.
- **Mentorship Opportunities**: A feature that enables mentors or more senior group members to indicate their availability for different types of mentorship (e.g., resume review, code review). Members can sign up for these slots.

## Installation
